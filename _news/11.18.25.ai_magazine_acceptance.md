Our publication titled "Human at the Center: A Framework for Human-Driven AI Development" was accepted to **AAAI AI Magazine**. We propose a structured framework for designing and evaluating human-AI systems that center human judgment, agency, and ethics. It synthesizes technical, practical, and ethical insights to outline four modes of human–AI collaboration, emphasize evaluation with real users, and highlight issues of fairness, labor, privacy, and human agency in AI development. We hope this paper will help researchers and practitioners build AI systems that are not only effective, but deeply aligned with human needs, values, and real-world contexts.
