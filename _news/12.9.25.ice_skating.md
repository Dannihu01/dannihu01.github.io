I organized an ice skating event for CSEG members that brought together a huge turnout of graduate students! Many participants stepped onto the ice for the very first time. It was rewarding to create an accessible, welcoming space where students could try something new, connect outside the lab, and build stronger community ties. The enthusiasm and shared excitement made it one of CSEG’s most memorable social gatherings to date.
