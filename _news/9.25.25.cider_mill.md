I organized a fall trip to the historic Dexter Cider Mill, giving CSEG members a chance to unwind off-campus and enjoy fresh cider, donuts, and peak-season scenery. The event brought together students from across CSEG for a relaxed afternoon of conversation, community building, and autumn vibes! So happy to see everyone there!
